 * @brief Singly linked list
 * @author Alexander Saprykin
 *
 * A singly linked list is a data structure consists of the nodes which
 * represent a sequence. Each node contains a data pointer and a pointer to the
 * next node. Every node has a link only to the next node, hence list is a
 * singly linked (in a single direction).
 *
 * As the singly linked list is a linear collection of the nodes with the
 * sequential access, it has an O(N) average complexity for appending, removing
 * and searching operations. Prepending a node takes O(1) constant time. Thus it
 * is not intended for heavy usage, please refer to #PHashTable or #PTree if you
 * are working with large data sets.
 *
 * Before the first usage you must initialize a #PList variable to NULL. After
 * that you can use the p_list_append(), p_list_prepend(), p_list_remove() and
 * p_list_reverse() routines to update that variable:
 * @code
 * PList       *list;
 * ppointer    data;
 *
 * list = NULL;
 * data = my_obj_new ();
 *
 * list = p_list_append (list, data);
 * @endcode
 * #PList stores only the pointers to the data, so you must free used memory
 * manually, p_list_free() only frees list's internal memory, not the data it
 * stores the pointers for. The best approach to free used memory is the
 * p_list_foreach() routine:
 * @code
 * PList    *list;
 * ...
 * p_list_foreach (list, (PFunc) my_free_func, my_data);
 * p_list_free (list);
 * @endcode
 * Also you can use #P_INT_TO_POINTER and #P_POINTER_TO_INT macros to store
 * integers (up to 32-bit) without allocating memory for them:
 * @code
 * PList    *list;
 * pint     a;
 *
 * list = p_list_append (list, P_INT_TO_POINTER (12));
 * a = P_POINTER_TO_INT (list->data);
 * @endcode
 * #PList can store several nodes with the same pointer value, but
 * p_list_remove() will remove only the first matching node.
 *
 * If you need to add large amount of nodes at once it is better to prepend them
 * and then reverse the list.
